                            <p>
                            Supply chain management is a critical factor of 
                            business success. As software increasingly drives
                            business value, organizations can achieve greater
                            efficiency, agility, and effectiveness - as well as
                            security - by applying similar principles to their
                            cyber supply chains. Vulnerabilities in components
                            such as processors, network stacks, and platform
                            dependencies have shown that supply chain visibility
                             is shallow, while risk runs deep.

                            The Supply Chain Sandbox is an interactive
                            environment, with hands on games and demonstrations
                            that illustrate supply chain issues, as well as
                            concepts and approaches to manage them more
